# Portfolio Website 

![](https://cloud-10u2le894-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0prismify-render-1738319292729.png) 

This is my portfolio website which I have built in a few hours, the interesting thing about is that there is a lot of work remaining in it. 

It uses nextjs and the background which you can see is a more developed version of [this project](https://github.com/jackyzha0/sunlit). Most of my time regarding this project is spent in converting the whole thing from CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and HTML to SSR, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. 

I hope you will love the further updates which are going to be added in it : )
